				ABSTRACT

	An extended and revised solar extreme ultraviolet irradiance 
model for aeronomical use during the 1990's has been developed. The extensions 
significantly increase the application of the SERF2 solar EUV model beyond 
the October 1981 -- April 1989 timeframe. The model can now be used from 
1947 to the present for coronal EUV full-disk irradiances and from 1976 to 
the present for chromospheric EUV full-disk irradiances. Substantial revisions 
to SERF2 were made which significantly improve the ability of the model to 
reproduce observed 27-day and solar cycle EUV temporal variations. A multiple 
linear regression method is used to obtain coefficients for modeled EUV 
photon flux. This method allows for the inclusion of new rocket and satellite 
datasets into the model as they become available. The solar H Lyman-alpha 
and He I 10,830 A equivalent width measurements are used as the independent 
model parameters for the chromospheric irradiances while the 10.7-cm 
radio emission daily and 81-day running mean values are the independent 
parameters for the coronal and transition region irradiances. The results of 
the model give full-disk photon fluxes at 1 AU for 39 EUV wavelength groups 
and discrete lines between 1.8 and 105.0 nm for a given date. The OSO, AEROS, 
AE satellite datasets and six rocket datasets used in the model development 
are summarized, the modeling technique is described in detail, the model 
formulation is presented, and the comparisons of the model to the datasets are 
discussed. 

				INTRODUCTION

	Solar extreme ultraviolet (EUV) radiation which is emitted between the 
X-rays and the far ultraviolet is a combination of both line and continuum 
features. Its importance results from this spectrum's relationship with   
planetary thermospheres which are heated by EUV radiation through 
photoabsorption processes. For example, the Earth's upper atmosphere is 
significantly perturbed by this irradiance which is absorbed by the major 
neutral constituents of O, O2, and N2. 

	Schmidtke [1] outlined four aeronomically important solar spectral 
ranges. The 125.0-180.0 nm range heats the lower thermosphere through 
the production of O by O2 absorption in the Schumann-Runge continuum; 
the H Lyman-alpha line at 121.6 nm is a major contributor of the D-region 
ionosphere through the ionization of NO; the 16.0-103.0 nm range is the 
primary heat source of the thermosphere through major neutral constituent 
photoabsorption and creates the ionosphere E- and F-regions; and the 0.1-2.0 nm 
range contributes to the ionization of the D-region, particularly during active 
solar conditions. For a detailed understanding of the temporal variations 
of the thermosphere over solar rotation and solar cycle time scales, the 
temporal variations of the 2 to 103 nm range are of particular interest. 

	The EUV irradiances between 1.8 nm and H Lyman-alpha have been measured 
by numerous sounding rocket and satellite instruments. These measurements 
have been reviewed by Timothy [2], Schmidtke [1,3], and Lean [4]. Further 
rocket measurements have been described by Carlson et al. [5], Ogawa and 
Judge [6], Ogawa et al. [7], Woods and Rottman [8], and summarized by 
Feng et al. [9]. In essence, these papers describe over a dozen and a 
half sounding rocket measurements and measurements by the OSO, AEROS, and AE 
series satellites using both spectrophotometric and broadband ionization cell 
techniques during the 1960's through the 1980's. 

	These measurements have provided a wealth of information on the 
relative temporal variation of many line and continuum emission features 
in this spectral range. Important periodicities were discovered in the 
long-term solar cycle EUV variation and the ranges of absolute intensities 
within which these features vary were established. As such, these measurements 
laid the groundwork for solar EUV models which are used when measurements are 
unavailable. 

	Prior to measurements above the atmosphere, the first empirical EUV 
model can be found in the 1937 suggestion of Saha [10] that an ``ultraviolet 
excess factor'' be accounted for by scaling the EUV spectral region in a solar 
black body radiating at 6500 K by 1E6.  Following a successful rocket 
observation of a broad spectrum in the EUV during 1963, Hinteregger et al. 
[11] tabulated an EUV flux standard for quiet solar conditions. This was 
followed by the compilation by Donnelly and Pope [12] of an EUV model 
spectrum for moderate solar activity which summarized the subsequent 
successful observations. Hinteregger [13] reviewed the advances in 
measuring EUV irradiances following the Atmospheric Explorer-C (AE-C) mission 
in the mid-1970's and Heroux and Hinteregger [14] released a revised reference 
spectrum for moderate solar activity based upon a detailed study of a 1974 
rocket flight. Roble and Schmidtke [15] described a variety of typical EUV flux 
examples applied to aeronomical calculations for different solar conditions. 

	However, the most complete empirical models were first developed 
by Hinteregger et al. [16] following the completion of the AE-E mission. 
Two empirical models emerged from this work including the EUV class model and 
the two variable 10.7 cm radio flux, F10.7, association formula. The EUV 
class model was limited to the timeframe of the AE-E mission (July 1977 
through December 1980) and used the chromospheric H Lyman-beta flux to 
estimate other chromospheric emission intensities and used the Fe XVI 
(33.5 nm) coronal line to estimate other coronal and transition region 
(hereafter referred to as coronal) emission intensities. The association 
formula used both F10.7 daily and 81-day mean values in a linear 
correlation with AE-E EUV flux values in order to estimate EUV irradiances 
outside that timeframe. These combined models were later designated SERF1 by 
the Solar Electromagnetic Radiation Flux Study group which worked under the 
auspices of the World Ionosphere - Thermosphere Study (WITS) organized by 
the Scientific Committee on Solar-Terrestrial Physics (SCOSTEP). 

	Following the SERF1 model, Tobiska [17] developed a two index EUV 
flux model based on the Hinteregger et al. [16] EUV class model concept 
and the AE-E dataset. This model used H Lyman-alpha to estimate the 
chromospheric irradiances and 0.1-0.8 nm X-rays to estimate the coronal 
irradiances. Tobiska and Barth [18] improved this model by replacing the 
0.1-0.8 X-ray index with the F10.7 daily values and by utilizing additional, 
mostly broadband, rocket measurements of the EUV to lower the uncertainty 
on the absolute integrated irradiance values. This model was subsequently 
designated SERF2 and covered the timeframe between October 1981 and April 
1989. Tobiska [19] detailed the SERF2 model development. 

	SERF1 and SERF2 were compared by Lean [20] over timescales of the 
27-day solar rotation and the 11-year solar cycle. Significant differences 
were found between the two models and between the models and the datasets upon 
which each were based. The differences appeared in the estimation of absolute 
intensities, the magnitude of peak-to-valley variation of irradiance due to 
solar rotation, and the maximum to minimum flux values over the 11-year solar 
cycle. The conclusion of that study indicated neither models nor measurements 
yet provided a consistent picture of long-term variability in the EUV portion 
of the sun's spectrum. 

	The revisions and extension of the SERF2 model in the present study 
are part of the continuing effort to improve empirical solar EUV modeled 
irradiances such that the uncertainties are better known in both models and 
datasets and such that the models become a useful tool for estimating solar 
EUV irradiance for aeronomical use. 

			EUV MODEL DEVELOPMENT

SERF2 IMPROVEMENTS

	SERF2 represented an advance for empirical solar EUV irradiance 
modeling based upon 1) the extension of the EUV class method to time periods 
outside of the AE-E dataset and 2) the high correlations of the Lyman-alpha and 
F10.7 proxies with the AE-E chromospheric and coronal irradiances, 
respectively. However, a detailed analysis of the model identified the 
following inconsistencies and limitations. Two of the inconsistencies are 
apparent when the model is directly compared to datasets and one subtle 
physical inconsistency was discovered. A significant limitation of SERF2 
resulted from its application only to the 1981-1989 timeframe. 

	Tobiska [19] and Lean [20] both indicated that several of the SERF2 
chromospheric lines, including the He I 58.4 nm, He II 30.4 nm, and the 
H Lyman-beta 102.6 nm features, did not show large enough relative amplitude 
variation over 27-day solar rotation timescales when compared to OSO 4, OSO 6, 
and AE-E datasets. In addition, there was a concern that the absolute 
magnitudes of these particular lines were too low and that the ratios of solar 
cycle maximum to minimum values were too low. It was later determined that the 
method of weighting the slope coefficient rather than the intercept in the 
SERF2 linear equations was the most probable cause of this inconsistency. This 
subsequently raised concerns about the overall usefulness of this weighting 
method. 

	A second concern raised about the SERF2 model was its use of the daily 
F10.7 value, but not the 81-day mean value, combined with an H Lyman-alpha 
proxy in estimating the coronal irradiances. The F10.7 81-day mean value 
used by SERF1 has been recognized as a way of improving the F10.7 and EUV 
emission correlations, particularly for coronal emissions.

	A third concern about the model was pointed out by Link [private 
communication, 1990] who demonstrated that SERF2 did not reproduce physically 
consistent H Lyman and C I continua. The 5.0 nm wavelength interval boundaries 
in the SERF2 modeled continuum flux were not consistent in magnitude with the 
neighboring continuum interval. 

	An open question which was addressed by SERF2 and which still remains 
to be resolved is the debate on whether or not the 5.0-57.5 nm total integrated 
flux for low solar activity should be higher than the irradiances measured 
by rockets in the 1970's. Richards and Torr [21], Ogawa and Judge [6], Link 
et al. [22], Winningham et al. [23], and Tobiska [24] indicate that the 
estimates of some or all of the total flux in that wavelength range 
should be higher during low solar activity by up to a factor of 2. SERF2 
produced total integrated flux of about 1.6 greater than the rocket data. The 
present model produces total 5.0-57.5 nm integrated flux values which match 
the rocket data. However, in the subrange of 5.0-25.0 nm, the model 
consistently produces higher flux for all levels of solar activity than 
the AE-E data. This result supports the conclusions of Richards and Torr [21] 
who determined that a doubling of the solar EUV below 25.0 nm was needed to 
explain measured photoelectron fluxes. This issue will be addressed later in 
the evaluation of this new model. 

DATASETS USED IN THE MODEL DEVELOPMENT

	Six satellite EUV datasets, including OSO 1 (28.4 and 30.4 nm), OSO 3 
(25.6, 28.4, and 30.4 nm), OSO 4 (30.4 nm), OSO 6 (30.4 and 58.4 nm), AEROS A 
(28.4, 30.4, and 58.4 nm), and AE-E (14.0-105.0 nm), were used in the 
development of this model. Each dataset was weighted for instrument 
uncertainty. These EUV data were combined with data from six rocket flights, 
also weighted, to obtain the irradiances at EUV wavelengths for correlation 
with the model proxies. The six rockets included three ionization cell or 
silicon photodiode instruments flown by the University of Southern California 
and described by Carlson et al. [5], Ogawa and Judge [6], and Ogawa 
et al. [7], two spectrographs flown by the University of Colorado described by 
Woods and Rottman [8] and Woods [private communication, 1991], and one 
spectrometer flown by the Air Force Geophysics Laboratory described by 
Van Tassel et al. [25]. Table 1 lists the characteristics of these datasets 
by satellite, wavelength coverage, year(s) of observations, literature 
reference, and uses in model development. 

	The model proxies, which are independent datasets used to establish a 
correlation between either chromospheric or coronal irradiances or to extend 
the estimate of these irradiances outside the original EUV data timeframes, 
include the Solar Mesosphere Explorer (SME) Lyman-alpha described by Barth et 
al. [26], the AE-E Lyman-alpha described by Hinteregger et al. [16], the 
OSO 4 Lyman-alpha described by Timothy and Timothy [27], the OSO 6 Lyman-alpha 
described by Woodgate et al. [28], the He I 10,830 A equivalent width 
(EW) described by Harvey [29], and the Ottawa F10.7 provided by the World 
Data Center A. 

MODELING TECHNIQUE AND FORMULATION

	The revision and extension of the SERF2 model was conducted using 
a multiple linear regression technique which is different from the simple 
least squares fitting routine used to develop the original SERF2 model. The 
advantage of using a multiple linear regression algorithm in this new model is 
that several datasets from independent sources may be used to perform the 
new correlations. With the number of independent terms greater than 1 for 
each of the chromospheric and coronal regressions, the new model 1) is 
now capable of including new proxies to extend the model backward or 
forward in time (as has been done with the He I 10,830 A EW data) or 2) is 
now able to take advantage of higher correlations obtained with mean value 
data (as has been done with the 81-day mean of the F10.7). Additionally, 
future independent datasets which prove to have high correlations with 
solar chromospheric or coronal irradiances can now be included. The 
weighting of the datasets is easily accomplished using the multiple linear 
regression algorithm. 

	In general, a chromospheric or coronal emission intensity, I, at a 
wavelength lambda may be modeled as a time-varying quantity at 1 AU as 

	I(lambda,t) = 
	  a0(lambda) + a1(lambda)F1(t) + a2(lambda)F2(t) + . . . +
                       an(lambda)Fn(t)                               (1)

in units of photons cm{-2} s{-1} with n independent terms according to 
the multiple linear regression technique described by Bevington [30]. 
The ai(lambda) coefficients are derived in the multiple linear regression 
and Fn(t) are the independent datasets (n = 4 for the model) which are the 
EUV proxies as used in this study. This relationship is based on the 
assumption that the independent terms vary linearly with the EUV flux 
with which they are being correlated. The assumption generally holds true 
for emissions which are created at the same temperature levels in the 
solar atmosphere. 

	This equation is modified to reproduce modeled flux during periods 
when one of the independent terms, or proxies, may not be available. A 
good example of this is between the end of AE-E in December 1980 and the start 
of SME in October 1981. During these 9 months, there were no Lyman-alpha data 
measured although He I 10,830 A EW measurements do exist. Therefore, an 
empirical function was developed to allow the production of the modeled flux 
even if one independent term is missing. This function has the dimensionless 
form

	wi(lambda,t) = 1 + bi(lambda) e^{-Si(t)}                     (2)

	W(lambda,t) = product{i=1}^{4}wi(lambda,t)                   (3)

where the wi(lambda,t) scaling term corresponds to the average ratio by 
which the Fj(t) independent term is multiplied in order to model the flux 
for the days which have missing data in the ith independent term. Si(t) 
is a step function which has a large value (<<1) for dates on which data 
exist for the ith independent term and a value of 0 for dates on which data 
do not exist for the ith independent term. In the exponent, -Si(t) causes 
bi(lambda) to be multiplied by 0 or 1 for data or no data, respectively, 
in the ith independent term. If the ith independent term data exist for a 
given date, the value of wi(lambda,t) reduces to unity. In practice, 
an equally valid alternative to using the weighting function is to set 
wi(lambda,t) to 1 and scale an existing proxy from the same solar 
temperature region to the value of the missing proxy on a given date. 

	Equation (1) can now be rewritten as

	Phi(lambda,t) = a0(lambda) + sum{i=1}^{4} ai(lambda)Fi(t)    (4)

	I(lambda,t) = Phi(lambda,t) W(lambda,t)                      (5)

again in units of photon flux.

	In the model, there are presently four independent datasets used 
where F1(t) is the SME Lyman-alpha, F2(t) is the He I 10,830 A EW scaled 
to Lyman-alpha values by equation (6) below, F3(t) is the daily F10.7, and 
F4(t) is the 81-day running mean value of F10.7. If the modeled flux is 
chromospheric in origin, then the coefficients of a3(lambda) and 
a4(lambda) are set to 0 or if the flux is coronal in origin, then the 
coefficients of a1(lambda) and a2(lambda) are set to 0. For wavelength 
intervals in which both chromospheric and coronal irradiances are modeled, 
each interval is calculated separately according to chromospheric or coronal 
classification with the final values then summed in order to produce a total 
flux for that particular wavelength interval. 

	Table 2 lists coefficients used in the model by 39 wavelength 
intervals or discrete lines and includes the solar source region (key) 
for each EUV wavelength, the value of a0(lambda) in equation (4), the 
values of ai(lambda) for i = 1,2,3,4 in equation (4), and the values of 
bi(lambda) for i = 1,2,3,4 in equation (2). These intervals and lines are 
identical to the divisions made in previous EUV investigations by Torr et 
al. [31], Torr and Torr [32], and Tobiska and Barth [18].

	Prior to performing the multiple linear regressions between the proxy 
datasets and the EUV irradiances, the proxy datasets are first searched 
for missing data followed by the insertion of a cubic spline interpolated 
value at the missing days. In practice, the F10.7 has very few missing data 
points with exceptions in solar cycles 18 and 19. The He I 10,830 A EW 
dataset contains a significant number of missing data points and the cubic 
spline is extensively used here. For ease of use in the model, the He I 10,830 
A EW data, originally in units of milliA, are converted to an equivalent 
SME Lyman-alpha flux by the relationship

	F{Lyman-alpha} = F{He I 10,830 EW} 3.7784687E9 + 8.4031723E10 (6)

in units of photons cm^{-2} s^{-1}. Equation (6) is used to create the F2(t) 
dataset mentioned above. The SME Lyman-alpha dataset contains values for 
all dates except one or two. The OSO 4, OSO 6, and AEROS A Lyman-alpha data 
contain no missing datapoints as a result of the digitizing method used 
to create the datasets from the published figures and, finally, the AE-E 
Lyman-alpha dataset contains a substantial number of missing days where 
cubic splined data values are used. The datasets of EUV irradiance, which 
contain missing data, are not splined. The correlations are then performed 
between the proxy data, which is splined in the above cases, and the 
existing, measured, unsplined EUV irradiances. 

	While calculating the correlations between the independent data and 
a particular EUV wavelength interval or discrete line, several constraints 
were imposed upon the calculations. First, all EUV datasets were weighted with 
the uncertainties published by the experimenters although, in most cases, 
the uncertainties in the data were increased based either upon discussions with 
the experimenters or upon a comparison with other datasets when more than two 
sets of measurements were available for similar levels of solar activity. 

	Next, below 30.0 nm a first-order approximation to a rocket spectrum 
was created for each of the 3 USC datasets [5, 6, 7]. This was accomplished 
by scaling the August 1979 AFGL rocket flight spectrum described by Van 
Tassel et al. [25] by the appropriate ratio so that the total spectrum 
between 5.0-57.5 nm equaled the total integrated flux value obtained by the 
USC experimenters. The uncertainty introduced by this approximation is 
certainly large even though the AFGL flight occurred under similar levels of 
solar activity. However, the resulting estimated flux values in this 
wavelength region for the USC rocket flights were almost always within 
+-50% of the model values which were derived only from a correlation with 
the AE-E dataset. Often the model versus estimated flux differences were within 
+-20%. These estimated rocket values were then used to scale the absolute 
magnitude of the AE-E data such that the model would best fit the estimated 
USC flux within a +-55% uncertainty range but still fall within the AE-E 
uncertainty range of +-35%. The exception using this technique below 30.0 nm 
was the calculation of the 25.6 nm irradiance which resulted in model 
values 65% higher than the AE-E values. 

	Between 1.8-5.0 nm, only the AFGL data as provided by the NSSDC 
were used in the correlation. It is possible that model fluxes in this 
range should be scaled upwards by as much as 50% for a first order 
approximation. Supporting this scaling is recent work by Barth et al. [33] 
and Siskind et al. [34] who, in analyzing NO in the lower thermosphere, 
suggest that the NSSDC values between 1.8-5.0 nm be raised in order to 
account for photoelectron flux needed to enhance the ionization of N2. 

	Above 30.0 nm the same scaling technique which modifies the absolute 
value of the AE-E data was used such that the model matched the least 
uncertain of the measured intervals and lines of the November 10, 1988 and 
June 20, 1989 LASP rockets. In some cases described below, this technique was 
modified with additional constraints. All but a few of the model values were 
within +-10-50% of the AE-E flux for a given wavelength. The cases in which 
the comparisons were worse than this are those wavelength ranges which were 
forced to an absolute level by the continuum emission constraint described 
in the next paragraph. Above 30.0 nm the estimated USC data were not used 
in the determination of the absolute magnitude. However, in most cases, 
there were good to moderate agreements between the estimated USC data and 
the model where the scatter of differences ranged between +-5-75%. Except 
for the He II 30.4 nm emission, for which the AE-E dataset was given the 
most weight in order to best represent all the data, the USC estimates 
and model differences were attributable to greater weights given to the 
LASP narrowband spectrograph measurements or continuum emission constraints. 
The LASP rockets' measurement uncertainties varied by wavelength (see Table 
1) and, for modeling purposes, the values given with those datasets were 
doubled to provide +-2 sigma uncertainties. 

	An important empirical constraint related to the continuum emission 
was added to the model. For the three continua of He I (45.3-50.4 nm), H Lyman 
(70.0-91.2 nm), and C I (91.3-105.0 nm) an empirical limitation was imposed in 
order to make adjacent longer wavelength interval boundaries produce an 
irradiance consistent with an increase relative to its neighbor in the 
preceeding, shorter wavelength interval. The estimated value of the continuum 
flux in a wavelength interval for a given date was derived by scaling the 
reference continuum given by Hinteregger et al. [16] in the SC21REFW 
spectrum by the ratio of Lyman-alpha and He I 10,830 A EW on that date 
above their solar minimum values. This scaling philosophy is based upon 
the assumption that the continua irradiances in all three cases originate 
in the solar chromosphere. The modeled flux for wavelength intervals which 
include those continua were forced to match the expected scaled continua 
without regard for most discrete lines. In half of the cases, the model 
continua values were within +-20% or less of the rocket or AE-E data. The 
exceptions tended to be some of emissions measured by the 1989 LASP rocket 
and AE-E, both of which had higher emission intensities by up to a factor 
of 2 than those derived from the model. 

	The model is constructed to take advantage of potentially new 
independent proxies such as the 530.3 nm coronal green line of Fe XIV. 
Possible new indices for chromospheric emission include the Mg II core-to-wing 
ratio R(Mg II cw) described by Heath and Schlesinger [35] and the Ca II K 1 
A index described by White et al. [36]. The Fe XIV may complement the F10.7 
as a purely coronal index depending upon the results of further research. 
The Mg II and Ca II K index are both substitutes for Lyman-alpha when the 
latter is unavailable. Tobiska and Bouwer [37] give a relationship between 
Mg II and Lyman-alpha 

	F{Lyman-alpha} = R(Mg II cw) 1.785E12 - 1.515E12              (7)

in photons cm^{-2} s^{-1}. White et al. [36] give a relationship between Ca 
II K and Lyman-alpha 

	F{Lyman-alpha} = K{index} 108 - 6.92                          (8)

in units of 1E11 photons cm^{-2} s^{-1}.

COMPARISON OF MODEL AND DATASETS

	The independent datasets upon which this model is constructed are 
shown in Figure 1. All proxies are corrected to 1 AU. The (a) SME Lyman-alpha 
is described by Barth et al. [26], the (b) He I 10,830 A EW is described 
by Harvey [29], the (c) Ottawa F10.7 daily flux is available from the 
World Data Center A and is described originally by Covington [38], and 
the (d) 81-day running mean value of F10.7 is from the same sources as (c). 
The timeframe in all four panels is from January 1, 1962 through December 31, 
1989. Units in the time axis are in days. The maxima of solar cycles 20 and 21 
can be seen in these panels as well as the rise of cycle 22. In addition, 
the 27-day solar rotational modulations are observed. 

	Selected model and data discrete line and interval irradiances are 
shown in the time series Figures 2 and 3. These are some of the lines and 
intervals which contribute the greatest heating to the Earth's thermosphere 
as demonstrated by Roble [39]. Figure 2 shows the 15-19.9 nm coronal emission, 
the Fe XV 28.4 nm coronal line, the He II 30.4 nm chromospheric line, the 
30.3-35 nm coronal emission (excluding Si XI at 30.3 nm), the He I 58.4 nm 
chromospheric line, and the H Lyman-beta 102.6 nm chromospheric line. In 
each of the panels, the data are shown as solid lines and the model as dotted 
lines. USC estimated rocket flight data are shown as open diamonds while the 
LASP rocket data are shown as boxes. Each panel shows the time series in 
days, with biennial intervals labeled, from January 1, 1962 through December 
31, 1989 where the flux is in units of photons cm^{-2} s^{-1}. The solar 
source regions and wavelength line or interval in A is shown in each panel. 

	In Figure 2, the coronal irradiances are modeled for the entire 
period from 1962 through 1989 since the F10.7 exists for the entire period. 
The chromospheric irradiances in this figure have limited representation in 
1968, 1969, and late 1974-early 1976 but have daily values starting in late 
1976. OSO 4 and OSO 6 measured Lyman-alpha in 1968 and 1969, respectively, 
while He I 10,830 A EW measurements exist beginning in late 1974. 

	In Figure 3, each panel shows the same emission ranges or lines as 
in Figure 2. The AE-E data is again shown as a solid line and the model as 
a dotted line for 500 days beginning August 10, 1977. This figure compares 
data with the model during the rise of solar cycle 21. One notes that the 
relative magnitude of variation of the model compared to the data for both 
27-day solar rotational and 11-year solar cycle timeframes are similar. 
Additionally, the coefficients of linear correlation with the independent term 
(F{1-4}) are shown in each panel.

	Three representative model spectra are shown in Figure 4 for low, 
moderate, and high solar activity. The first panel in Figure 4 shows the 
modeled spectrum for November 26, 1985 (85330 in the year-day format) 
during low solar activity when the F10.7 = 70. The modeled spectrum for 
November 10, 1988 (88315) is shown in the second panel for the time of the 
LASP rocket flight when F10.7 = 148 during moderate activity. The third 
panel shows the spectrum for August 10, 1982 (82222) during the USC rocket 
flight when F10.7 = 210 during high solar activity. The range of flux covers 
five orders of magnitude; discrete lines as well as continua are apparent. 
The model spectra was created by using the SC21REFW reference spectrum, 
scaling it's data to the modeled flux values, and superimposing the modeled 
discrete lines onto the spectrum. The total integrated flux between 50-575 
A is also shown in each panel. 

	Finally, Figure 5 is mostly based upon Ogawa et al. [7] and shows the 
total integrated flux between 5.0-57.5 nm for eighteen rocket flights 
including the three USC experiments. In this figure, the total integrated flux 
is compared to F10.7 on the date of the rocket flight. Superimposed upon the 
figure are the results of several model runs for a variety of solar activity 
conditions. The modeled datapoints are shown as filled circles without error 
bars. During low, moderate, and high solar conditions, the model reproduces 
very well the observed integrated solar flux. The dates of the models runs are 
79050 (1979, day 50), 79226, 79314, 82222, 83228, 85330, 88298, and 88315 
which correspond to high activity days, low activity days, or dates of rocket 
flights. 

	As noted earlier, there has been discussion in the literature regarding 
the magnitude of the integrated flux values during low solar activity when 
F10.7 is in the low 70's. One argument suggests that low solar activity total 
integrated flux should be higher by a factor of 1.5-2 based upon 1) 
calculations of the solar flux needed to produce measured photoelectron fluxes 
and 2) the extrapolation of a line through the low uncertainty USC 
measurements. The other argument notes that 1) three separate rocket 
flights measured consistent flux levels for low solar activity and 2) the 
5.0-57.5 nm range contains a substantial amount of chromospheric irradiance 
which should vary non-linearly with F10.7 by analogy to the Lyman-alpha, 
Mg II, and He I 10,830 comparisons with F10.7. Since the model uses 
two of these three chromospheric indices, it is not suprising that the 
model 1) shows a non-linear relationship with F10.7 during low solar activity, 
2) does not follow a direct extrapolation from moderate levels of solar 
activity, and 3) reproduces flux consistent with rocket data. The three low 
activity rocket datasets were not used directly in the model derivation but 
did indirectly affect the model to the extent that they were used in 
calibrating the AE-E EUV flux. However, it is possible that only the flux 
levels in wavelengths shortward of 25.0 nm need to be increased over the AE-E 
values while the irradiance above 25.0 nm does not need to be increased 
substantially. This combination allows increased photoelectron production yet 
maintains a non-linear relationship with F10.7 during low solar activity. The 
controversy remains an open question and demonstrates the importance of 
obtaining well calibrated solar EUV measurements during the next solar minimum 
in the mid-1990's. 

				CONCLUSIONS

	The present solar EUV irradiance model was developed as an extension 
and revision of the SERF2 model. The 39 wavelength intervals or discrete lines 
between 1.8--105.0 nm are modeled as either chromospheric or coronal 
irradiances which vary over time with solar rotational or longer-term solar 
dynamical periodicities including the 11-year solar cycle. The modeled flux is 
representative of an average full-disk EUV irradiance on a given date at 
1 AU at the top of the atmosphere. The model was constructed particularly 
for use in aeronomical calculations. The daily modeled spectrum can be used 
in a variety of formats, including broadband integrated flux in the 5.0-57.5 
nm range, as 39 wavelength intervals and lines, or at a resolution of 1-2 A 
with divisions identical to those of the SC21REFW reference spectrum. 

	The modeling technique utilizes two independent datasets for each of 
the chromospheric and coronal irradiances within a multiple linear regression 
algorithm which allows for the weighting of each EUV dataset according to 
instrumental uncertainty. Uncertainties were utilized in the derivation of the 
model. An empirical function incorporated into the model allows for the 
calculation of an irradiance even if only one independent term exists. 

	The present work is an improvement over SERF1 in its 1) ability to 
distinguish between chromospheric and coronal irradiance variations outside 
the AE-E timeframe and 2) self-consistency with the datasets which were 
used to derive the model. Improvements over SERF2 include 1) the ability 
to reproduce the same relative magnitude of variation over 27-day solar 
rotational and 11-year solar cycle time periods as the datasets for all 
wavelengths, 2) the ability to incorporate new datasets and/or independent 
proxies as they become available, and 3) the extension of the model beyond 
the SME Lyman-alpha timeframe. The model can be extended even further in time 
(forward and possibly backward for the chromospheric irradiances) as 
ground-based and/or satellite measurements of the proxies continue to be made. 

	Future improvements in the modeling of solar EUV irradiance will come 
with increased satellite and rocket measurements in this part of the spectrum 
at a variety of levels of solar activity. New measurements of the short 
wavelength solar EUV during solar minimum conditions in the mid-1990's, 
particularly of the integrated flux and the discrete lines down to 1.8 nm, 
would certainly contribute to resolving open questions regarding existing 
models and data. Narrowing the model uncertainty may also be possible through 
the use of improved or new independent proxies. Finally, short-term solar EUV 
flux prediction may soon be possible as the evolution and decay of solar 
active regions are better understood and this information is incorporated into 
the solar EUV models.
